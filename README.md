# Reservation
Capstone project for LaunchCode
I will be creating a reservation page for a restaurant that will clearly indicate the day of the week that someone is trying to make a reservation. This has been an issue with the website that the restuarant I currently work at has been having for months. Users are unable to make a reservation the day of so I want to be sure to block off past dates and the current day. While adding a note letting users know that we do not accept online reservations the day of but they can call the restaurant the day of. Users will be able to book up to 3 months in advance. There will be a place to select the date, the time of the reservation, and how many people will be in the party. Users will have to input their name, phone number and email address for a confirmation email. When clicking the submit button, there will be a popup with the date, with the actual day of the week, time and number of people in their party and they will have to click confirm again. This reservation will be sent to the restaurant's system, letting them confirm or deny the inquiry. A confirmation or denial email will then be sent to the user with the date, day of the week, time and number of people. Emphasis put on the day of the week. I'd like to improve the restaurant's website and help people see the date.
